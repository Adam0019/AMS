Account Management System (AMS)

#Introduction:-
The Account Management System, or AMS, is an application specifically designed for small business owners and shopkeepers to record their daily transactions in a balance sheet format. It tracks every credit and debit made to their bank account, as the user can easily store bank details. It also stores customer information for verification during future purchases or in the event of any issues. Currently, it is free to use. Version 1.0 includes these features, but future updates, such as a live ledger to monitor every customer payment and a real-time P&L graph for daily profit or loss, will be added in version 1.1.

#Requirements:-
The AMS is built using basic HTML and PHP. For styling, it employs Bootstrap and CSS, while functionality is implemented with jQuery and standard JavaScript. The database and hosting are managed through SQL and XAMPP Local Host. The entire code is developed using Visual Studio Code.

#Objective:-
The main objective of designing the AMS was to help small business owners and shopkeepers have a digital record of everyday transactions with a live profit/loss check system, so they can be updated with daily profits made. The software also keeps every customer's details, so the user can monitor their payments or debits. It also has a feature to show the current bank balance of the user after every transaction made once they enter their bank details.
